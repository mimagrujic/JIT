# üõ†Ô∏è Jit - Simplified Git

Jit is a simplified version of Git written in C++. 

## üöÄ Features
  - Repository initialization
      - Creation of .jit directory with all its necessary components(`objects`, `refs/branches`, `head` and `index`)
  - Staging
      - Creating blob objects out of existing files in current working directory
      - Updating index file accordingly
  - Committing
      - Creating working repo's tree object and commit object
  - Branch operations
      - Creating a new branch
      - Switching between branches
      - Deleting a branch
      - Listing current/all branches
  - Resetting
      - Implementation of all 3 reset options: `soft`, `mixed` and `hard`
  - Accessing commit history
  - Object type/content check:
      - Implementation of `git cat-file -t/-p <hash>` function

   1. Clone the repository:
      ```

## üöß Limitations / Known Issues
- Does not support merging, conflict resolution, or rebase operations
- Does not support working with remote repositories
## ‚úÖ Project Goals
The goals of this project were to:
  - Deepen my understanding of Git
  - Understand how Git works under the hood
## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap / Next Steps 
  - Merge and rebase support
  - Reflog implementation
